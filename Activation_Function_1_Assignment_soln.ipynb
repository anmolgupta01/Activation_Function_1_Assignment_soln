    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction of Non-Linearity:**\n",
    "   Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network. This non-linearity allows the network to model complex relationships and patterns in the data. Without activation functions, the entire neural network would behave like a linear model, limiting its ability to learn and represent intricate features.\n",

    "3. **Avoiding Vanishing and Exploding Gradients:**\n",
    "   Certain activation functions, like ReLU, help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by allowing the gradient to flow more easily during backpropagation. This is crucial for training deep networks, as it helps prevent the gradients from becoming too small and slowing down learning (or conversely, too large and causing instability).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparsity and Feature Representation:**\n",
